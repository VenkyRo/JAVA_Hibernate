Description:
This repository contains a Java application that leverages Hibernate ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for database operations. Hibernate simplifies the interaction with relational databases by mapping Java objects to database tables. The application is designed to demonstrate CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and showcase advanced Hibernate features like caching, lazy loading, and HQL (Hibernate Query Language).

Features:

ORM with Hibernate: Automates database table mapping with Java entity classes.
CRUD Operations: Seamlessly performs Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the database.
HQL: Demonstrates complex queries using Hibernate Query Language.
Lazy and Eager Loading: Optimized data fetching for performance.
Caching: Includes first- and second-level caching to reduce database access.
Transaction Management: Ensures consistency with Hibernate's transaction API.
Annotations-Based Configuration: Simplifies configuration using Hibernate and JPA annotations.
Integration with MySQL/PostgreSQL/Other RDBMS: Supports multiple relational database systems.
Technologies Used:

Backend: Java, Hibernate ORM, JPA
Database: MySQL/PostgreSQL
Build Tool: Maven/Gradle
IDE: IntelliJ IDEA/Eclipse
